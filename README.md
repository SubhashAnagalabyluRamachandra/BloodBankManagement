# Blood Bank Management Database Project

## Overview
This project involves the creation of a relational database schema for a healthcare system. It includes tables for patients, donors, and blood banks, with constraints, primary keys, and foreign keys to ensure data integrity. Sample data is inserted into the tables to demonstrate functionality. Additionally, a stored function named GetDonorsByReport is defined to retrieve donors based on their medical report status. SQL queries are provided to select and display information from the tables.

## Key Features
- **Relational database schema design:** Ensuring a structured and efficient database layout.
- **Tables for patients, donors, and blood banks:** Representing key entities within the healthcare system.
- **Data integrity constraints:** Including primary keys, foreign keys, and check constraints.
- **Sample data insertion:** Facilitating a practical demonstration of the database's capabilities.
- **Stored function for querying donors:** Utilizing GetDonorsByReport to retrieve donors by medical report status.
- **SQL queries for retrieving and displaying information:** Empowering users to interact with and visualize data.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **PostgreSQL database server:** Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database server installed.
3. **Run the SQL script:** Execute the provided SQL script to create the database schema and insert sample data.
4. **Execute SQL queries:** Retrieve information from the database tables by running the provided SQL queries.
5. **Explore functionality:** Take the time to explore the functionality and experiment with the stored function.

## Usage
- **Review SQL script:** Examine the SQL script for database creation, data insertion, and stored function definition.
- **Execute SQL queries:** Utilize the provided SQL queries to interact with the database tables.
